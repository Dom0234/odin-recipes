      <h2>Description</h2>
      <p> French toast is a dish made of sliced bread soaked in beaten eggs and typically milk, then pan fried. 
          When French toast is served as a sweet dish, milk, sugar, vanilla or cinnamon are also commonly added before pan-frying, and 
          then it may be topped with sugar (often powdered sugar), butter, fruit, or syrup. When it is a savory dish, it is generally fried
          with a pinch of salt or pepper, and it can then be served with a sauce such as ketchup or mayonnaise.

            <li>Whisk together Egg Mixture (eggs, milk, cinnamon & vanilla) in a bowl. Vigorous whisk = avoid cinnamon floating on top.</li>
            <li>Melt 1 tbsp of butter in a non stick skillet over medium heat.</li>
            <li>Dunk a piece of bread quickly into the egg mixture, coating both sides. Place in pan. Repeat with more slices to fill the pan, but donâ€™t crowd it (do 2 or 3 at a time).</li>
            <li>Cook for 2.5-3 minutes on each side until the surface is golden. Then transfer to serving plates.</li>
            <li>Add more butter into the pan and cook remaining bread.</li>
            <li>Serve with butter and plenty of maple syrup, and strawberries if using!</li>
